This repository contains clustering algorithms for Gaussian mixture model-based clustering. It will also contain k-means clustering in the future. These are my own implementations of these algorithms.

The implementations are intended to be run in Jupyter Notebooks, but I have also included Python files if you wish to run the code in an IDE such as IDLE (Python).

Gaussian mixture model-based clustering:

- [x] Show probabilities of each point being assigned to each cluster at each iteration
- [x] Show updated cluster means at each iteration
- [x] Display updated cluster prior probabilities at each iteration


K-means clustering:

- [ ] Show the assignment of points to clusters at each iteration
- [ ] Show the updated cluster centers at each iteration
